# Covid-Data-Analysis-Final-Project
Data Analysis Assignment 6

Data Source:
[COVID-19 in USA | Kaggle]

Objective:
* To determine the states with the most Covid-19 cases and death rate and try to understand the correlation. The goal is to understand when and where the most Covid-19 cases and deaths are so that medical staff, provisions, and equipment can be appropriately distributed throughout the country.

Tools:
Jupyter and Tableau

Language:
Python

Conclusion:
* New York is the state with the highest number of Covid-19 related deaths
* November and October are the months with the highest number of deaths and the highest number of hospitalizations

* The months when flu season typically take place in the USA are also the month with the highest number of deaths and hospitalizations. This is likely because that time of year is common for people to get sick, and with a virus that spreads as rapidly as Covid-19 it is not surprising that these are the months where it hits the hardest. It is also probably due to the timeline of the virus. Covid-19 was abstract at the beginning of 2020, until it came to the USA and then became a very real problem. The numbers started off low, and then increased drastically as the months passed and medical professionals were working on learning more about the virus. There is still so much that is unknown so it’s going to take time to learn everything there is to know about the virus and all the possible symptoms. It’s been two years now and we’re still in the midst of a pandemic. 

Recommendations for Future Analysis:
* Although things are improving with the virus, it is still very much prevalent, and if we continue following the protocols provided by the CDC and WHO, we will be able to eventually move on from this pandemic. Already we can see the number of deaths dropped drastically between 2020 and now, so it is clear to see that we are on the path to recovery, although it will be a long journey ahead. 

* Some things that would be interesting to look into in a future analysis would be looking at the cases and deaths after the vaccine came out and see which of the people who got Covid-19 and had severe symptoms were vaccinated or not. Did the people who passed away from Covid-19 have the vaccine? These would be some questions to ask for looking into the Covid-19 data now and in the future.
